# DeepfakeDetectionWeb
This project is a Flask-based web application for detecting deepfake images using a custom-trained deep learning model. The system provides an intuitive UI where users can upload an image, and it instantly predicts whether the image is **Real** or **Fake**, along with a confidence score and a visual confidence bar.
